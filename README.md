 Crop-Recommendation-System
 This is my third year AD Lab Project.
 This project is based on Ml models used to predict the best crop recommendation for more productivity in farming.
 The ML models used in this project are:
   -KNN Classification Model 
   -Naive Bayes Algorithm
   -Decision Tree (CART Algorithm)

For backend we used Flask,python.
For frontend we used HTML and CSS for styling.

Requirements :
  -Python
  -Flask
  -HTML
  -CSS

MY CONTRIBUTION  :
YEJJI AKASH  
Role: Backend Developer & Machine Learning Engineer  

Contributions: 
- Designed and implemented the backend architecture.  
- Developed and optimized backend code for efficient system performance.  
- Trained and tested the machine learning model for accurate crop recommendations.  
- Ensured seamless integration between the backend and other system components

The frontend part is managed by my  colleagues.

That's all for this project, See you in next exiting projects keep in touch.
